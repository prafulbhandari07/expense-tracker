# Expense Tracker (Using Context API ) :

This application is built using Context API. The difference between Context API and Redux lies in how they handle state changes. Redux takes a centralized approach, where state changes are managed in a central store. On the other hand, Context API deals with state changes on a components level, as they happen within each component.
